# **Mile to Km Converter**

## **Overview:**
This is the Day 27 project from the 100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp.

This is a simple GUI-based application built using Tkinter in Python. It allows users to convert miles to kilometers by entering a value in miles and clicking the "Calculate" button.

## **How It Works:**
1. The user enters a value (in miles) into the input field.
2. Clicking the "Calculate" button triggers the conversion.
3. The entered value is multiplied by 1.60934 to get the equivalent kilometers.
4. The result is displayed in the GUI.
